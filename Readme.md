p5-tag-GA

This simple program should represent a Tag-Game between two Teams.
The attack-team has a time to catch all the opponents. If they do not catch all of them,
the opponents win.
Both teams can evolve (You can choose in the settings if a team should evolve).
The fitness value of the attack team will be determined by the catched opponents.
The fitness value of the opponents will be determined by the lifetime until catched.
